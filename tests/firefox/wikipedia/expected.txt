   Mozilla is a free-software community, created in 1998 by members of
   Netscape. The Mozilla community uses, develops, spreads and supports
   Mozilla products, thereby promoting exclusively free software and open
   standards, with only minor exceptions.^[1] The community is supported
   institutionally by the Mozilla Foundation and its tax-paying subsidiary,
   the Mozilla Corporation.^[2]

   Mozilla produces many products such as the Firefox web browser,
   Thunderbird e-mail client, Firefox Mobile web browser, Firefox OS mobile
   operating system, Bugzilla bug tracking system and other projects.

History[edit]

   On January 23, 1998, Netscape made two announcements: first, that Netscape
   Communicator will be free; second, that the source code will also be
   free.^[3] One day later, Jamie Zawinski from Netscape registered
   mozilla.org.^[4] The project was named Mozilla after the original code
   name of the Netscape Navigator browser which is a blending of "Mosaic and
   Godzilla"^[5] and used to co-ordinate the development of the Mozilla
   Application Suite, the open source version of Netscape's internet
   software, Netscape Communicator.^[6]^[7] Jamie Zawinski says he came up
   with the name "Mozilla" at a Netscape staff meeting.^[8]^[9] A small group
   of Netscape employees were tasked with coordination of the new community.

   Originally, Mozilla aimed to be a technology provider for companies, such
   as Netscape, who would commercialize their open source code.^[10] When AOL
   (Netscape's parent company) greatly reduced its involvement with Mozilla
   in July 2003, the Mozilla Foundation was designated the legal steward of
   the project.^[11] Soon after, Mozilla deprecated the Mozilla Suite in
   favor of creating independent applications for each function, primarily
   the Firefox web browser and the Thunderbird email client, and moved to
   supply them directly to the public.^[12]

   Recently, Mozilla's activities have expanded to include Firefox on mobile
   platforms (primarily Android),^[13] a mobile OS called Firefox OS,^[14] a
   web-based identity system called Mozilla Persona and a marketplace for
   HTML5 applications.^[15]

   In a report released in November 2012, Mozilla reported that their total
   revenue for 2011 was $163 million, which was up 33% from $123 million in
   2010. Mozilla noted that roughly 85% of their revenue comes from their
   contract with Google.^[16]

   At the end of 2013, Mozilla announced a deal with Cisco Systems whereby
   Firefox would download and use a Cisco-provided binary build of an open
   source^[17] codec to play the proprietary H.264 video format.^[18]^[19] As
   part of the deal, Cisco would pay any patent licensing fees associated
   with the binaries that it distributes. Mozilla's CTO, Brendan Eich,
   acknowledged that this is "not a complete solution" and isn't
   "perfect".^[20] An employee in Mozilla's video formats team, writing in an
   unofficial capacity, justified^[21] it by the need to maintain their large
   user base, which would be necessary in future battles for truly free video
   formats.

   In December 2013, Mozilla announced funding for the development of
   non-free games^[22] through its Game Creator Challenge. However, even
   those games that may be released under a non-free software or open source
   license must be made with open web technologies and Javascript as per the
   work criteria outlined in the announcement.

  Eich CEO promotion controversy[edit]

   On March 24, 2014, Mozilla promoted Brendan Eich to the role of CEO. This
   led to boycotts and protests from the LGBT community and its supporters,
   as Eich previously donated US$1,000^[23] in 2008 in support of
   California's Proposition 8, a California ballot proposition and state
   constitutional amendment in opposition to same-sex marriage.^[24] Eich's
   donation first became public knowledge in 2012, while he was Mozilla’s
   chief technical officer, leading to angry responses on Twitter—including
   the use of the hashtag "#wontworkwithbigots".^[25]

   Protests also emerged in 2014 following the announcement of Eich's
   appointment as CEO of Mozilla. U.S. companies OkCupid and CREDO Mobile
   received media coverage for their objections, with the former asking its
   users to boycott the browser,^[26] while Credo amassed 50,000 signatures
   for a petition that called for Eich's resignation

   Due to the controversy, Eich voluntarily stepped down on April 3,
   2014^[27] and Mitchell Baker, executive chairwoman of Mozilla Corporation,
   posted a statement on the Mozilla blog: "We didn’t move fast enough to
   engage with people once the controversy started. Mozilla believes both in
   equality and freedom of speech. Equality is necessary for meaningful
   speech. And you need free speech to fight for equality."^[28] Eich's
   resignation promoted a larger backlash from conservatives who felt he had
   been forced out of the company internally.^[citation needed]

   OkCupid co-founder and CEO Sam Yagan had also donated $500^[29] to
   Republican candidate Chris Cannon who proceeded to vote for multiple
   measures viewed as "anti-gay", including the banning of same-sex
   marriage.^[30]^[31]^[32]^[33] Yagan claims he did not know about Cannon's
   stance on gay rights and that his contribution was due to the candidate
   being the ranking Republican participating in the House subcommittee that
   oversaw Internet and Intellectual Property
   matters.^[34]^[35]^[36]^[37]^[38]

   Reader comments on articles that were published close to the events were
   divided between support for OkCupid's actions and opposition to them.
   Supporters claimed the boycott was justified and saw OkCupid's actions as
   a firm statement of opposition to intolerance towards the gay community.
   Opponents saw OkCupid's actions as hypocritical, since Eich is also the
   inventor of JavaScript, which is still required to browse OkCupid's
   website, and felt that users should not be punished for the actions of
   Mozilla and suspected that OkCupid's actions were a publicity
   stunt.^[36]^[39]

Values[edit]

   According to Mozilla's manifesto,^[40] which outlines goals, principles,
   and a pledge, "The Mozilla project uses a community-based approach to
   create world-class open source software and to develop new types of
   collaborative activities". Mozilla's manifesto mentions only its beliefs
   in regards to the Internet and Internet privacy, and has no mention of any
   political or social viewpoints.

  Pledge[edit]

   According to the Mozilla Foundation:^[41]

     The Mozilla Foundation pledges to support the Mozilla Manifesto in its
     activities. Specifically, we will:

       * Build and enable open-source technologies and communities that
         support the Manifesto’s principles;
       * Build and deliver great consumer products that support the
         Manifesto’s principles;
       * Use the Mozilla assets (intellectual property such as copyrights and
         trademarks, infrastructure, funds, and reputation) to keep the
         Internet an open platform;
       * Promote models for creating economic value for the public benefit;
         and
       * Promote the Mozilla Manifesto principles in public discourse and
         within the Internet industry.

Software[edit]

   [IMG]

  Firefox[edit]

   Firefox is a web browser, and is Mozilla's flagship software product. It
   is available in both desktop and mobile versions. Firefox uses the Gecko
   layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and
   anticipated web standards.^[42] As of late 2015, Firefox has approximately
   10-11% of worldwide usage share of web browsers, making it the 4th
   most-used web browser.^[43]^[44]^[45]

   Firefox began as an experimental branch of the Mozilla codebase by Dave
   Hyatt, Joe Hewitt and Blake Ross. They believed the commercial
   requirements of Netscape's sponsorship and developer-driven feature creep
   compromised the utility of the Mozilla browser.^[46] To combat what they
   saw as the Mozilla Suite's software bloat, they created a stand-alone
   browser, with which they intended to replace the Mozilla Suite.

   Firefox was originally named Phoenix but the name was changed so as to
   avoid trademark conflicts with Phoenix Technologies. The
   initially-announced replacement, Firebird, provoked objections from the
   Firebird project community.^[47]^[48] The current name, Firefox, was
   chosen on February 9, 2004.^[49]

  Firefox Mobile[edit]

   Firefox Mobile (codenamed Fennec) is the build of the Mozilla Firefox web
   browser for devices such as smartphones and tablet computers.

   Firefox Mobile uses the same Gecko layout engine as Mozilla Firefox. For
   example, version 1.0 used the same engine as Firefox 3.6, and the
   following release, 4.0, shared core code with Firefox 4.0. Its features
   include HTML5 support, Firefox Sync, add-ons support and tabbed
   browsing.^[50]

   Firefox Mobile is currently available for Android 2.2 and above devices
   with an ARMv7 or ARMv6 CPU.^[51] The x86 architecture is not officially
   supported.^[52] Tristan Nitot, president of Mozilla Europe, has said that
   it's unlikely that an iPhone or a BlackBerry version will be released,
   citing Apple's iTunes Store application approval policies (which forbid
   applications competing with Apple's own, and forbid engines which run
   downloaded code) and BlackBerry's limited operating system as the
   reasons.^[53]

  Firefox OS[edit]

   Firefox OS (project name: Boot to Gecko also known as B2G) is an open
   source operating system in development by Mozilla that aims to support
   HTML5 apps written using "open Web" technologies rather than
   platform-specific native APIs. The concept behind Firefox OS is that all
   user-accessible software will be HTML5 applications, that use Open Web
   APIs to access the phone's hardware directly via JavaScript.^[54]

   Some devices using this OS include^[55] Alcatel One Touch Fire, ZTE Open,
   LG Fireweb.

  Thunderbird[edit]

   Thunderbird is a free, open source, cross-platform email and news client
   developed by the volunteers of the Mozilla Community.

   On July 16, 2012, Mitchell Baker announced that Mozilla's leadership had
   come to the conclusion that on-going stability was the most important
   thing for Thunderbird and that innovation in Thunderbird was no longer a
   priority for Mozilla. In that update Baker also suggested that Mozilla had
   provided a pathway for community to innovate around Thunderbird if the
   community chooses.^[56]

  SeaMonkey[edit]

   [IMG]

   SeaMonkey (formerly the Mozilla Application Suite) is a free and open
   source cross platform suite of Internet software components including a
   web browser component, a client for sending and receiving email and USENET
   newsgroup messages, an HTML editor (Mozilla Composer) and the ChatZilla
   IRC client.

   On March 10, 2005, the Mozilla Foundation announced that it would not
   release any official versions of Mozilla Application Suite beyond 1.7.x,
   since it had now focused on the standalone applications Firefox and
   Thunderbird.^[57] SeaMonkey is now maintained by the SeaMonkey Council,
   which has trademarked the SeaMonkey name with help from the Mozilla
   Foundation.^[58] The Mozilla Foundation provides project hosting for the
   SeaMonkey developers.

  Bugzilla[edit]

   [IMG]

   Bugzilla is a web-based general-purpose bug tracking system, which was
   released as open source software by Netscape Communications in 1998 along
   with the rest of the Mozilla codebase, and is currently stewarded by
   Mozilla. It has been adopted by a variety of organizations for use as a
   bug tracking system for both free and open source software and proprietary
   projects and products, including the Mozilla Foundation, the Linux kernel,
   GNOME, KDE, Red Hat, Novell, Eclipse and LibreOffice.^[59]

  Components[edit]

    NSS[edit]

   Network Security Services (NSS) comprises a set of libraries designed to
   support cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
   applications. NSS provides a complete open-source implementation of crypto
   libraries supporting SSL and S/MIME. NSS was previously tri-licensed under
   the Mozilla Public License 1.1, the GNU General Public License, and the
   GNU Lesser General Public License, but upgraded to GPL-compatible MPL 2.0.

   AOL, Red Hat, Sun Microsystems/Oracle Corporation, Google and other
   companies and individual contributors have co-developed NSS and it is used
   in a wide range of non-Mozilla products including Evolution, Pidgin, and
   Apache OpenOffice.

    SpiderMonkey[edit]

   SpiderMonkey is the original JavaScript engine developed by Brendan Eich
   when he invented JavaScript in 1995 as a developer at Netscape. It became
   part of the Mozilla product family when Mozilla inherited Netscape's
   code-base in 1998. In 2011, Eich transferred the nominal ownership of the
   SpiderMonkey code and project to Dave Mandelin.^[60]

   SpiderMonkey is a cross-platform engine written in C++ which implements
   ECMAScript, a standard developed from JavaScript.^[60]^[61] It comprises
   an interpreter, several just-in-time compilers, a decompiler and a garbage
   collector. Products which embed SpiderMonkey include Firefox, Thunderbird,
   SeaMonkey, and many non-Mozilla applications.^[62]

    Rhino[edit]

   Rhino is an open source JavaScript engine managed by the Mozilla
   Foundation. It is developed entirely in Java. Rhino converts JavaScript
   scripts into Java classes. Rhino works in both compiled and interpreted
   mode.^[63]

    Gecko[edit]

   Gecko is a layout engine that supports web pages written using HTML, SVG,
   and MathML. Gecko is written in C++ and uses NSPR for platform
   independence. Its source code is licensed under the Mozilla Public
   License.

   Firefox uses Gecko both for rendering web pages and for rendering its user
   interface. Gecko is also used by Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, and many
   non-Mozilla applications.

    Rust[edit]

   Rust is a compiled programming language being developed by Mozilla
   Research. It is designed for safety, concurrency, and performance. Rust is
   intended for creating large and complex software which needs to be both
   safe against exploits and fast.

   Rust is being used in an experimental layout engine, Servo, which is
   developed by Mozilla and Samsung. Servo is not used in any
   consumer-oriented browsers yet. However, the Servo project developers plan
   for parts of the Servo source code to be merged into Gecko, and Firefox,
   incrementally.^[64]^[65]

    XULRunner[edit]

   XULRunner is a software platform and technology experiment by Mozilla,
   that allows applications built with the same technologies used by Firefox
   extensions (XPCOM, Javascript, HTML, CSS, XUL) to be run natively as
   desktop applications, without requiring Firefox to be installed on the
   user's machine. XULRunner binaries are available for the Windows,
   GNU/Linux and OS X operating systems, allowing such applications to be
   effectively cross platform.

    pdf.js[edit]

   Pdf.js is a library developed by Mozilla that allows in-browser rendering
   of pdf documents using the HTML5 Canvas and Javascript. It is included by
   default in recent versions of Firefox, allowing the browser to render pdf
   documents without requiring an external plugin; and it is available
   separately as an extension named "PDF Viewer" for Firefox for Android,
   SeaMonkey, and the Firefox versions which don't include it built-in. It
   can also be included as part of a website's scripts, to allow pdf
   rendering for any browser that implements the required HTML5 features and
   can run Javascript.

    Shumway[edit]

   Shumway is an open source replacement for the Adobe Flash Player,
   developed by Mozilla since 2012, using open web technologies as a
   replacement for Flash technologies. It uses Javascript and HTML5 Canvas
   elements to render Flash and execute Actionscript. It is included by
   default in Firefox Nightly and can be installed as an extension for any
   recent version of Firefox. The current implementation is limited in its
   capabilities to render Flash content outside simple projects.

Other activities[edit]

  Mozilla VR[edit]

   Mozilla VR is a team focused on bringing Virtual reality tools,
   specifications, and standards to the open Web.^[66] Mozilla VR maintains
   A-Frame (VR), a web framework for building VR experiences, and works on
   advancing WebVR support within web browsers.

  Mozilla Persona[edit]

   Mozilla Persona is a secure, cross-browser website authentication
   mechanism which allows a user to use a single username and password (or
   other authentication method) to log in to multiple sites.^[67] Mozilla
   Persona will be shutting down on November 30, 2016.^[68]

  Mozilla Location Service[edit]

   This open source crowdsourced geolocation service was started by Mozilla
   in 2013 and offers a free API.

  Webmaker[edit]

   Mozilla Webmaker is Mozilla's educational initiative, Webmaker's goal is
   to "help millions of people move from using the web to making the web." As
   part of Mozilla’s non-profit mission, Webmaker aims "to help the world
   increase their understanding of the web, take greater control of their
   online lives, and create a more web literate planet."^[69]^[70]^[70]

  Mozilla Developer Network[edit]

   Mozilla maintains a comprehensive developer documentation website called
   the Mozilla Developer Network which contains information about web
   technologies including HTML, CSS, SVG, JavaScript, as well
   Mozilla-specific information. In addition, Mozilla publishes a large
   number of videos about web technologies and the development of Mozilla
   projects on the Air Mozilla website.^[71]^[72]

[edit]

   The Mozilla Community consists of over 40,000 active contributors from
   across the globe^[citation needed]. It includes both paid employees and
   volunteers who work towards the goals set forth^[40] in the Mozilla
   Manifesto. Many of the sub-communities in Mozilla have formed around
   localization efforts for Mozilla Firefox, and the Mozilla web properties.

  Local communities[edit]

   [IMG]

   There are a number of sub-communities that exist based on their
   geographical locations, where contributors near each other work together
   on particular activities, such as localization, marketing, PR and user
   support.

  Mozilla Reps[edit]

   [IMG]

   The Mozilla Reps program aims to empower and support volunteer Mozillians
   who want to become official representatives of Mozilla in their
   region/locale.

   The program provides a simple framework and a specific set of tools to
   help Mozillians to organize and/or attend events, recruit and mentor new
   contributors, document and share activities, and support their local
   communities better.

   When joining the program, a Mozilla Rep agrees to take on the following
   responsibilities:

     * Represent Mozilla in their country/region
     * Promote the Mozilla Project and its mission
     * Build on and support existing/future local community efforts and
       programs
     * Inspire, recruit and support new contributors
     * Support and mentor future Mozilla Reps
     * Document clearly all their activities

  Conferences and events[edit]

    Mozilla Festival[edit]

   [IMG]

   Speakers from the Knight Foundation discuss the future of news at the 2011
   Mozilla Festival in London.

   The Mozilla Festival is an annual event where hundreds of passionate
   people explore the Web, learn together and make things that can change the
   world. With the emphasis on making—the mantra of the Festival is "less
   yack, more hack." Journalists, coders, filmmakers, designers, educators,
   gamers, makers, youth and anyone else, from all over the world, are
   encouraged to attend, with attendees from more than 40 countries, working
   together at the intersection between freedom, the Web, and that years
   theme.

   The event revolves around design challenges which address key issues based
   on the chosen theme for that years festival. In previous years the Mozilla
   Festival has focused on Learning, and Media, with the 2012 festival being
   based around making. The titles of the festival revolve around the main
   theme, freedom (as in freedom of speech not free beer), and the Web.

    MozCamps[edit]

   MozCamps are the critical part of the Grow Mozilla initiative which aims
   to grow the Mozilla Community. These camps aim to bring core contributors
   from around the world together. They are intensive multi-day summits that
   include keynote speeches by Mozilla leadership, workshops and breakout
   sessions (led by paid and unpaid staff), and fun social outings. All of
   these activities combine to reward contributors for their hard work,
   engage them with new products and initiatives, and align all attendees on
   Mozilla's mission.

    Mozilla Summit[edit]

   Mozilla Summit are the global event with active contributors and Mozilla
   employees to develop a shared understanding of Mozilla's mission together.
   Over 2,000 people representing 90 countries and 114 languages gathered in
   Santa Clara, Toronto and Brussels in 2013. Mozilla has since its last
   summit in 2013 replaced summits with all-hands where both employees and
   volunteers come together to collaborate the event is a scaled down version
   of Mozilla Summit.
