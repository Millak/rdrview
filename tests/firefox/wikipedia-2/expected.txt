   New Zealand (Māori: Aotearoa [aɔˈtɛaɾɔa]) is a sovereign island country in
   the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two
   main landmasses—the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui), and the South Island (Te
   Waipounamu)—and around 600 smaller islands. It has a total land area of
   268,000 square kilometres (103,500 sq mi). New Zealand is situated some
   2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and
   roughly 1,000 kilometres (600 mi) south of the Pacific island areas of New
   Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the
   last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation,
   New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal, and plant
   life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such
   as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic
   eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most
   populous city is Auckland.

   Sometime between 1250 and 1300, Polynesians settled in the islands that
   later were named New Zealand and developed a distinctive Māori culture. In
   1642, Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New
   Zealand. In 1840, representatives of the United Kingdom and Māori chiefs
   signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which declared British sovereignty over the
   islands. In 1841, New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire
   and in 1907 it became a dominion; it gained full statutory independence in
   1947 and the British monarch remained the head of state. Today, the
   majority of New Zealand's population of 4.9 million is of European
   descent; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority, followed by Asians
   and Pacific Islanders. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture is mainly
   derived from Māori and early British settlers, with recent broadening
   arising from increased immigration. The official languages are English,
   Māori, and New Zealand Sign Language, with English being very dominant.

   A developed country, New Zealand ranks highly in international comparisons
   of national performance, such as quality of life, health, education,
   protection of civil liberties, and economic freedom. New Zealand underwent
   major economic changes during the 1980s, which transformed it from a
   protectionist to a liberalised free-trade economy. The service sector
   dominates the national economy, followed by the industrial sector, and
   agriculture; international tourism is a significant source of revenue.
   Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral
   Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet,
   led by the prime minister, currently Jacinda Ardern. Queen Elizabeth II is
   the country's monarch and is represented by a governor-general, currently
   Dame Patsy Reddy. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional
   councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes. The
   Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the
   Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New
   Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial
   claim in Antarctica. New Zealand is a member of the United Nations,
   Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
   Development, ASEAN Plus Six, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the
   Pacific Community and the Pacific Islands Forum.

Etymology

   Brown square paper with Dutch writing and a thick red, curved line

   Detail from a 1657 map showing the western coastline of "Nova Zeelandia".
   (In this map, north is at the bottom.)

   Dutch explorer Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand in 1642 and named it Staten
   Land "in honour of the States General" (Dutch parliament). He wrote, "it
   is possible that this land joins to the Staten Land but it is
   uncertain",^[11] referring to a landmass of the same name at the southern
   tip of South America, discovered by Jacob Le Maire in 1616.^[12]^[13] In
   1645, Dutch cartographers renamed the land Nova Zeelandia after the Dutch
   province of Zeeland.^[14]^[15] British explorer James Cook subsequently
   anglicised the name to New Zealand.^[16]

   Aotearoa (pronounced ; often translated as "land of the long white
   cloud")^[17] is the current Māori name for New Zealand. It is unknown
   whether Māori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of
   Europeans, with Aotearoa originally referring to just the North
   Island.^[18] Māori had several traditional names for the two main islands,
   including Te Ika-a-Māui (the fish of Māui) for the North Island and Te
   Waipounamu (the waters of greenstone) or Te Waka o Aoraki (the canoe of
   Aoraki) for the South Island.^[19] Early European maps labelled the
   islands North (North Island), Middle (South Island) and South (Stewart
   Island / Rakiura).^[20] In 1830, mapmakers began to use "North" and
   "South" on their maps to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907
   this was the accepted norm.^[16] The New Zealand Geographic Board
   discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had
   never been formalised, and names and alternative names were formalised in
   2013. This set the names as North Island or Te Ika-a-Māui, and South
   Island or Te Waipounamu.^[21] For each island, either its English or Māori
   name can be used, or both can be used together.^[21]

History

   One set of arrows point from Taiwan to Melanesia to Fiji/Samoa and then to
   the Marquesas Islands. The population then spread, some going south to New
   Zealand and others going north to Hawai'i. A second set start in southern
   Asia and end in Melanesia.

   The Māori people are most likely descended from people who emigrated from
   Taiwan to Melanesia and then travelled east through to the Society
   Islands. After a pause of 70 to 265 years, a new wave of exploration led
   to the discovery and settlement of New Zealand.^[22]

   New Zealand was one of the last major landmasses settled by humans.
   Radiocarbon dating, evidence of deforestation^[23] and mitochondrial DNA
   variability within Māori populations^[24] suggest New Zealand was first
   settled by Eastern Polynesians between 1250 and 1300,^[19]^[25] concluding
   a long series of voyages through the southern Pacific islands.^[26] Over
   the centuries that followed, these settlers developed a distinct culture
   now known as Māori. The population was divided into iwi (tribes) and hapū
   (subtribes) who would sometimes cooperate, sometimes compete and sometimes
   fight against each other.^[27] At some point a group of Māori migrated to
   Rēkohu, now known as the Chatham Islands, where they developed their
   distinct Moriori culture.^[28]^[29] The Moriori population was all but
   wiped out between 1835 and 1862, largely because of Taranaki Māori
   invasion and enslavement in the 1830s, although European diseases also
   contributed. In 1862 only 101 survived, and the last known full-blooded
   Moriori died in 1933.^[30]

   Map of the New Zealand coastline as Cook charted it on his first visit in
   1769–70. The track of the Endeavour is also shown.

   The first Europeans known to have reached New Zealand were Dutch explorer
   Abel Tasman and his crew in 1642.^[31] In a hostile encounter, four crew
   members were killed and at least one Māori was hit by canister shot.^[32]
   Europeans did not revisit New Zealand until 1769 when British explorer
   James Cook mapped almost the entire coastline.^[31] Following Cook, New
   Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American whaling,
   sealing and trading ships. They traded European food, metal tools, weapons
   and other goods for timber, Māori food, artefacts and water.^[33] The
   introduction of the potato and the musket transformed Māori agriculture
   and warfare. Potatoes provided a reliable food surplus, which enabled
   longer and more sustained military campaigns.^[34] The resulting
   intertribal Musket Wars encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and
   1840, killing 30,000–40,000 Māori.^[35] From the early 19th century,
   Christian missionaries began to settle New Zealand, eventually converting
   most of the Māori population.^[36] The Māori population declined to around
   40% of its pre-contact level during the 19th century; introduced diseases
   were the major factor.^[37]

   A torn sheet of paper

   In 1788 Captain Arthur Phillip assumed the position of Governor of the new
   British colony of New South Wales which according to his commission
   included New Zealand.^[38] The British Government appointed James Busby as
   British Resident to New Zealand in 1832 following a petition from northern
   Māori.^[39] In 1835, following an announcement of impending French
   settlement by Charles de Thierry, the nebulous United Tribes of New
   Zealand sent a Declaration of Independence to King William IV of the
   United Kingdom asking for protection.^[39] Ongoing unrest, the proposed
   settlement of New Zealand by the New Zealand Company (which had already
   sent its first ship of surveyors to buy land from Māori) and the dubious
   legal standing of the Declaration of Independence prompted the Colonial
   Office to send Captain William Hobson to claim sovereignty for the United
   Kingdom and negotiate a treaty with the Māori.^[40] The Treaty of Waitangi
   was first signed in the Bay of Islands on 6 February 1840.^[41] In
   response to the New Zealand Company's attempts to establish an independent
   settlement in Wellington^[42] and French settlers purchasing land in
   Akaroa,^[43] Hobson declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand
   on 21 May 1840, even though copies of the Treaty were still circulating
   throughout the country for Māori to sign.^[44] With the signing of the
   Treaty and declaration of sovereignty the number of immigrants,
   particularly from the United Kingdom, began to increase.^[45]

   Black and white engraving depicting a crowd of people

   New Zealand, still part of the colony of New South Wales, became a
   separate Colony of New Zealand on 1 July 1841.^[46] Armed conflict began
   between the Colonial government and Māori in 1843 with the Wairau Affray
   over land and disagreements over sovereignty. These conflicts, mainly in
   the North Island, saw thousands of Imperial troops and the Royal Navy come
   to New Zealand and became known as the New Zealand Wars. Following these
   armed conflicts, large amounts of Māori land was confiscated by the
   government to meet settler demands.^[47]

   The colony gained a representative government in 1852 and the first
   Parliament met in 1854.^[48] In 1856 the colony effectively became
   self-governing, gaining responsibility over all domestic matters other
   than native policy.^[48] (Control over native policy was granted in the
   mid-1860s.^[48]) Following concerns that the South Island might form a
   separate colony, premier Alfred Domett moved a resolution to transfer the
   capital from Auckland to a locality near Cook Strait.^[49] Wellington was
   chosen for its central location, with Parliament officially sitting there
   for the first time in 1865.^[50]

   In 1891 the Liberal Party came to power as the first organised political
   party.^[51] The Liberal Government, led by Richard Seddon for most of its
   period in office,^[52] passed many important social and economic measures.
   In 1893 New Zealand was the first nation in the world to grant all women
   the right to vote^[51] and in 1894 pioneered the adoption of compulsory
   arbitration between employers and unions.^[53]

   In 1907, at the request of the New Zealand Parliament, King Edward VII
   proclaimed New Zealand a Dominion within the British Empire,^[54]
   reflecting its self-governing status.^[55] In 1947 the country adopted the
   Statute of Westminster, confirming that the British Parliament could no
   longer legislate for New Zealand without the consent of New Zealand.^[48]

   Early in the 20th century, New Zealand was involved in world affairs,
   fighting in the First and Second World Wars^[56] and suffering through the
   Great Depression.^[57] The depression led to the election of the First
   Labour Government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state
   and a protectionist economy.^[58] New Zealand experienced increasing
   prosperity following the Second World War^[59] and Māori began to leave
   their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of
   work.^[60] A Māori protest movement developed, which criticised
   Eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of Māori culture and of
   the Treaty of Waitangi.^[61] In 1975, a Waitangi Tribunal was set up to
   investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty, and it was enabled to
   investigate historic grievances in 1985.^[41] The government has
   negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi,^[62] although
   Māori claims to the foreshore and seabed have proved controversial in the
   2000s.^[63]^[64]

Government and politics

   New Zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary
   democracy,^[65] although its constitution is not codified.^[66] Elizabeth
   II is the Queen of New Zealand^[67] and thus the head of state.^[68] The
   Queen is represented by the governor-general, whom she appoints on the
   advice of the prime minister.^[69] The governor-general can exercise the
   Crown's prerogative powers, such as reviewing cases of injustice and
   making appointments of ministers, ambassadors and other key public
   officials,^[70] and in rare situations, the reserve powers (e.g. the power
   to dissolve parliament or refuse the royal assent of a bill into
   law).^[71] The powers of the monarch and the governor-general are limited
   by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised
   without the advice of ministers.^[71]

   The New Zealand Parliament holds legislative power and consists of the
   Queen and the House of Representatives.^[72] It also included an upper
   house, the Legislative Council, until this was abolished in 1950.^[72] The
   supremacy of parliament over the Crown and other government institutions
   was established in England by the Bill of Rights 1689 and has been
   ratified as law in New Zealand.^[72] The House of Representatives is
   democratically elected and a government is formed from the party or
   coalition with the majority of seats. If no majority is formed, a minority
   government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence
   and supply votes is assured.^[72] The governor-general appoints ministers
   under advice from the prime minister, who is by convention the
   parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition.^[73] Cabinet,
   formed by ministers and led by the prime minister, is the highest
   policy-making body in government and responsible for deciding significant
   government actions.^[74] Members of Cabinet make major decisions
   collectively, and are therefore collectively responsible for the
   consequences of these decisions.^[75]

   A parliamentary general election must be called no later than three years
   after the previous election.^[76] Almost all general elections between
   1853 and 1993 were held under the first-past-the-post voting system.^[77]
   Since the 1996 election, a form of proportional representation called
   mixed-member proportional (MMP) has been used.^[66] Under the MMP system,
   each person has two votes; one is for a candidate standing in the voter's
   electorate and the other is for a party. Since the 2014 election, there
   have been 71 electorates (which include seven Māori electorates in which
   only Māori can optionally vote),^[78] and the remaining 49 of the 120
   seats are assigned so that representation in parliament reflects the party
   vote, with the threshold that a party must win at least one electorate or
   5% of the total party vote before it is eligible for a seat.^[79]

   Elections since the 1930s have been dominated by two political parties,
   National and Labour.^[77] Between March 2005 and August 2006, New Zealand
   became the first country in the world in which all the highest offices in
   the land—head of state, governor-general, prime minister, speaker and
   chief justice—were occupied simultaneously by women.^[80] The current
   prime minister is Jacinda Ardern, who has been in office since 26 October
   2017.^[81] She is the country's third female prime minister.^[82]

   New Zealand's judiciary, headed by the chief justice,^[83] includes the
   Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, the High Court, and subordinate
   courts.^[84] Judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically
   and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain judicial
   independence.^[66] This theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret
   the law based solely on the legislation enacted by Parliament without
   other influences on their decisions.^[85]

   New Zealand is identified as one of the world's most stable and
   well-governed states.^[86] As at 2017, the country was ranked fourth in
   the strength of its democratic institutions,^[87] and first in government
   transparency and lack of corruption.^[88] A 2017 Human Rights Report by
   the U.S. Department of State noted that the government generally respected
   the rights of individuals, but voiced concerns regarding the social status
   of the Māori population.^[89] New Zealand ranks highly for civic
   participation in the political process, with 77% voter turnout during
   recent elections, compared to an OECD average of 69%.^[90]

  Foreign relations and military

   A squad of men kneel in the desert sand while performing a war dance

   Early colonial New Zealand allowed the British Government to determine
   external trade and be responsible for foreign policy.^[91] The 1923 and
   1926 Imperial Conferences decided that New Zealand should be allowed to
   negotiate its own political treaties and the first commercial treaty was
   ratified in 1928 with Japan. On 3 September 1939 New Zealand allied itself
   with Britain and declared war on Germany with Prime Minister Michael
   Joseph Savage proclaiming, "Where she goes, we go; where she stands, we
   stand."^[92]

   In 1951 the United Kingdom became increasingly focused on its European
   interests,^[93] while New Zealand joined Australia and the United States
   in the ANZUS security treaty.^[94] The influence of the United States on
   New Zealand weakened following protests over the Vietnam War,^[95] the
   refusal of the United States to admonish France after the sinking of the
   Rainbow Warrior,^[96] disagreements over environmental and agricultural
   trade issues and New Zealand's nuclear-free policy.^[97]^[98] Despite the
   United States' suspension of ANZUS obligations the treaty remained in
   effect between New Zealand and Australia, whose foreign policy has
   followed a similar historical trend.^[99] Close political contact is
   maintained between the two countries, with free trade agreements and
   travel arrangements that allow citizens to visit, live and work in both
   countries without restrictions.^[100] In 2013 there were about 650,000 New
   Zealand citizens living in Australia, which is equivalent to 15% of the
   resident population of New Zealand.^[101]

   New Zealand has a strong presence among the Pacific Island countries. A
   large proportion of New Zealand's aid goes to these countries and many
   Pacific people migrate to New Zealand for employment.^[102] Permanent
   migration is regulated under the 1970 Samoan Quota Scheme and the 2002
   Pacific Access Category, which allow up to 1,100 Samoan nationals and up
   to 750 other Pacific Islanders respectively to become permanent New
   Zealand residents each year. A seasonal workers scheme for temporary
   migration was introduced in 2007 and in 2009 about 8,000 Pacific Islanders
   were employed under it.^[103] A regional power,^[104] New Zealand is
   involved in the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Community, Asia-Pacific
   Economic Cooperation and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
   Regional Forum (including the East Asia Summit).^[100] New Zealand is a
   member of the United Nations,^[105] the Commonwealth of Nations^[106] and
   the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),^[107]
   and participates in the Five Power Defence Arrangements.^[108]

   New Zealand's military services—the Defence Force—comprise the New Zealand
   Army, the Royal New Zealand Air Force and the Royal New Zealand
   Navy.^[109] New Zealand's national defence needs are modest, since a
   direct attack is unlikely.^[110] However, its military has had a global
   presence. The country fought in both world wars, with notable campaigns in
   Gallipoli, Crete,^[111] El Alamein^[112] and Cassino.^[113] The Gallipoli
   campaign played an important part in fostering New Zealand's national
   identity^[114]^[115] and strengthened the ANZAC tradition it shares with
   Australia.^[116]

   In addition to Vietnam and the two world wars, New Zealand fought in the
   Second Boer War,^[117] the Korean War,^[118] the Malayan Emergency,^[119]
   the Gulf War and the Afghanistan War. It has contributed forces to several
   regional and global peacekeeping missions, such as those in Cyprus,
   Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Sinai, Angola, Cambodia, the
   Iran–Iraq border, Bougainville, East Timor, and the Solomon Islands.^[120]

   Chatham, Bounty, Antipodes, Snare, Auckland and Campbell Islands
   highlighted. New Zealand's segment of Antarctica (the Ross Dependency) is
   also highlighted.

   The early European settlers divided New Zealand into provinces, which had
   a degree of autonomy.^[121] Because of financial pressures and the desire
   to consolidate railways, education, land sales and other policies,
   government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in 1876.^[122]
   The provinces are remembered in regional public holidays^[123] and
   sporting rivalries.^[124]

   Since 1876, various councils have administered local areas under
   legislation determined by the central government.^[121]^[125] In 1989, the
   government reorganised local government into the current two-tier
   structure of regional councils and territorial authorities.^[126] The 249
   municipalities^[126] that existed in 1975 have now been consolidated into
   67 territorial authorities and 11 regional councils.^[127] The regional
   councils' role is to regulate "the natural environment with particular
   emphasis on resource management",^[126] while territorial authorities are
   responsible for sewage, water, local roads, building consents and other
   local matters.^[128]^[129] Five of the territorial councils are unitary
   authorities and also act as regional councils.^[129] The territorial
   authorities consist of 13 city councils, 53 district councils, and the
   Chatham Islands Council. While officially the Chatham Islands Council is
   not a unitary authority, it undertakes many functions of a regional
   council.^[130]

   The Realm of New Zealand, one of 16 Commonwealth realms,^[131] is the
   entire area over which the Queen of New Zealand is sovereign, and
   comprises New Zealand, Tokelau, the Ross Dependency, the Cook Islands and
   Niue.^[65] The Cook Islands and Niue are self-governing states in free
   association with New Zealand.^[132]^[133] The New Zealand Parliament
   cannot pass legislation for these countries, but with their consent can
   act on behalf of them in foreign affairs and defence. Tokelau is
   classified as a non-self-governing territory, but is administered by a
   council of three elders (one from each Tokelauan atoll).^[134] The Ross
   Dependency is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica, where it
   operates the Scott Base research facility.^[135] New Zealand nationality
   law treats all parts of the realm equally, so most people born in New
   Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau and the Ross Dependency are New
   Zealand citizens.^[136]^[n 7]

Environment

  Geography

   Islands of New Zealand as seen from satellite

   New Zealand is located near the centre of the water hemisphere and is made
   up of two main islands and a number of smaller islands. The two main
   islands (the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Māui, and the South Island, or Te
   Waipounamu) are separated by Cook Strait, 22 kilometres (14 mi) wide at
   its narrowest point.^[138] Besides the North and South Islands, the five
   largest inhabited islands are Stewart Island (across the Foveaux Strait),
   Chatham Island, Great Barrier Island (in the Hauraki Gulf),^[139]
   D'Urville Island (in the Marlborough Sounds)^[140] and Waiheke Island
   (about 22 km (14 mi) from central Auckland).^[141]

   The Southern Alps stretch for 500 kilometres down the South Island

   New Zealand is long and narrow (over 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) along its
   north-north-east axis with a maximum width of 400 kilometres (250
   mi)),^[142] with about 15,000 km (9,300 mi) of coastline^[143] and a total
   land area of 268,000 square kilometres (103,500 sq mi).^[144] Because of
   its far-flung outlying islands and long coastline, the country has
   extensive marine resources. Its exclusive economic zone is one of the
   largest in the world, covering more than 15 times its land area.^[145]

   The South Island is the largest landmass of New Zealand. It is divided
   along its length by the Southern Alps.^[146] There are 18 peaks over 3,000
   metres (9,800 ft), the highest of which is Aoraki / Mount Cook at 3,754
   metres (12,316 ft).^[147] Fiordland's steep mountains and deep fiords
   record the extensive ice age glaciation of this southwestern corner of the
   South Island.^[148] The North Island is less mountainous but is marked by
   volcanism.^[149] The highly active Taupo Volcanic Zone has formed a large
   volcanic plateau, punctuated by the North Island's highest mountain, Mount
   Ruapehu (2,797 metres (9,177 ft)). The plateau also hosts the country's
   largest lake, Lake Taupo,^[150] nestled in the caldera of one of the
   world's most active supervolcanoes.^[151]

   The country owes its varied topography, and perhaps even its emergence
   above the waves, to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the Pacific
   and Indo-Australian Plates.^[152] New Zealand is part of Zealandia, a
   microcontinent nearly half the size of Australia that gradually submerged
   after breaking away from the Gondwanan supercontinent.^[153] About 25
   million years ago, a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort
   and crumple the region. This is now most evident in the Southern Alps,
   formed by compression of the crust beside the Alpine Fault. Elsewhere the
   plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other,
   producing the Puysegur Trench to the south, the Hikurangi Trench east of
   the North Island, and the Kermadec and Tonga Trenches^[154] further
   north.^[152]

   New Zealand is part of a region known as Australasia, together with
   Australia.^[155] It also forms the southwestern extremity of the
   geographic and ethnographic region called Polynesia.^[156] The term
   Oceania is often used to denote the wider region encompassing the
   Australian continent, New Zealand and various islands in the Pacific Ocean
   that are not included in the seven-continent model.^[157]

  Climate

   New Zealand's climate is predominantly temperate maritime (Köppen: Cfb),
   with mean annual temperatures ranging from 10 °C (50 °F) in the south to
   16 °C (61 °F) in the north.^[158] Historical maxima and minima are 42.4 °C
   (108.32 °F) in Rangiora, Canterbury and −25.6 °C (−14.08 °F) in Ranfurly,
   Otago.^[159] Conditions vary sharply across regions from extremely wet on
   the West Coast of the South Island to almost semi-arid in Central Otago
   and the Mackenzie Basin of inland Canterbury and subtropical in
   Northland.^[160] Of the seven largest cities, Christchurch is the driest,
   receiving on average only 640 millimetres (25 in) of rain per year and
   Wellington the wettest, receiving almost twice that amount.^[161]
   Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch all receive a yearly average of more
   than 2,000 hours of sunshine. The southern and southwestern parts of the
   South Island have a cooler and cloudier climate, with around 1,400–1,600
   hours; the northern and northeastern parts of the South Island are the
   sunniest areas of the country and receive about 2,400–2,500 hours.^[162]
   The general snow season is early June until early October, though cold
   snaps can occur outside this season.^[163] Snowfall is common in the
   eastern and southern parts of the South Island and mountain areas across
   the country.^[158]

   The table below lists climate normals for the warmest and coldest months
   in New Zealand's six largest cities. North Island cities are generally
   warmest in February. South Island cities are warmest in January.

  Biodiversity

   Kiwi amongst sticks

   The endemic flightless kiwi is a national icon.

   New Zealand's geographic isolation for 80 million years^[165] and island
   biogeography has influenced evolution of the country's species of animals,
   fungi and plants. Physical isolation has caused biological isolation,
   resulting in a dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of very
   distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread
   species.^[166]^[167] About 82% of New Zealand's indigenous vascular plants
   are endemic, covering 1,944 species across 65 genera.^[168]^[169] The
   number of fungi recorded from New Zealand, including lichen-forming
   species, is not known, nor is the proportion of those fungi which are
   endemic, but one estimate suggests there are about 2,300 species of
   lichen-forming fungi in New Zealand^[168] and 40% of these are
   endemic.^[170] The two main types of forest are those dominated by
   broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps, or by southern beech in cooler
   climates.^[171] The remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands, the
   majority of which are tussock.^[172]

   Before the arrival of humans, an estimated 80% of the land was covered in
   forest, with only high alpine, wet, infertile and volcanic areas without
   trees.^[173] Massive deforestation occurred after humans arrived, with
   around half the forest cover lost to fire after Polynesian
   settlement.^[174] Much of the remaining forest fell after European
   settlement, being logged or cleared to make room for pastoral farming,
   leaving forest occupying only 23% of the land.^[175]

   An artist's rendition of a Haast's eagle attacking two moa

   The giant Haast's eagle died out when humans hunted its main prey, the
   moa, to extinction.

   The forests were dominated by birds, and the lack of mammalian predators
   led to some like the kiwi, kakapo, weka and takahē evolving
   flightlessness.^[176] The arrival of humans, associated changes to
   habitat, and the introduction of rats, ferrets and other mammals led to
   the extinction of many bird species, including large birds like the moa
   and Haast's eagle.^[177]^[178]

   Other indigenous animals are represented by reptiles (tuatara, skinks and
   geckos), frogs,^[179] spiders,^[180] insects (weta)^[181] and
   snails.^[182] Some, such as the tuatara, are so unique that they have been
   called living fossils.^[183] Three species of bats (one since extinct)
   were the only sign of native land mammals in New Zealand until the 2006
   discovery of bones from a unique, mouse-sized land mammal at least 16
   million years old.^[184]^[185] Marine mammals however are abundant, with
   almost half the world's cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and
   large numbers of fur seals reported in New Zealand waters.^[186] Many
   seabirds breed in New Zealand, a third of them unique to the
   country.^[187] More penguin species are found in New Zealand than in any
   other country.^[188]

   Since human arrival, almost half of the country's vertebrate species have
   become extinct, including at least fifty-one birds, three frogs, three
   lizards, one freshwater fish, and one bat. Others are endangered or have
   had their range severely reduced.^[177] However, New Zealand
   conservationists have pioneered several methods to help threatened
   wildlife recover, including island sanctuaries, pest control, wildlife
   translocation, fostering, and ecological restoration of islands and other
   selected areas.^[189]^[190]^[191]^[192]

Economy

   background.

   New Zealand has an advanced market economy,^[193] ranked 16th in the 2018
   Human Development Index^[8] and third in the 2018 Index of Economic
   Freedom.^[194] It is a high-income economy with a nominal gross domestic
   product (GDP) per capita of US$36,254.^[6] The currency is the New Zealand
   dollar, informally known as the "Kiwi dollar"; it also circulates in the
   Cook Islands (see Cook Islands dollar), Niue, Tokelau, and the Pitcairn
   Islands.^[195]

   Historically, extractive industries have contributed strongly to New
   Zealand's economy, focussing at different times on sealing, whaling, flax,
   gold, kauri gum, and native timber.^[196] The first shipment of
   refrigerated meat on the Dunedin in 1882 led to the establishment of meat
   and dairy exports to Britain, a trade which provided the basis for strong
   economic growth in New Zealand.^[197] High demand for agricultural
   products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New
   Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western
   Europe in the 1950s and 1960s.^[198] In 1973, New Zealand's export market
   was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Economic
   Community^[199] and other compounding factors, such as the 1973 oil and
   1979 energy crises, led to a severe economic depression.^[200] Living
   standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western
   Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all
   the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank.^[201] In the mid-1980s
   New Zealand deregulated its agricultural sector by phasing out subsidies
   over a three-year period.^[202]^[203] Since 1984, successive governments
   engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring (known first as Rogernomics
   and then Ruthanasia), rapidly transforming New Zealand from a protected
   and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free-trade
   economy.^[204]^[205]

   Blue water against a backdrop of snow-capped mountains

   Unemployment peaked above 10% in 1991 and 1992,^[207] following the 1987
   share market crash, but eventually fell to a record low (since 1986) of
   3.7% in 2007 (ranking third from twenty-seven comparable OECD
   nations).^[207] However, the global financial crisis that followed had a
   major impact on New Zealand, with the GDP shrinking for five consecutive
   quarters, the longest recession in over thirty years,^[208]^[209] and
   unemployment rising back to 7% in late 2009.^[210] Unemployment rates for
   different age groups follow similar trends, but are consistently higher
   among youth. In the December 2014 quarter, the general unemployment rate
   was around 5.8%, while the unemployment rate for youth aged 15 to 21 was
   15.6%.^[207] New Zealand has experienced a series of "brain drains" since
   the 1970s^[211] that still continue today.^[212] Nearly one quarter of
   highly skilled workers live overseas, mostly in Australia and Britain,
   which is the largest proportion from any developed nation.^[213] In recent
   decades, however, a "brain gain" has brought in educated professionals
   from Europe and less developed countries.^[214]^[215] Today New Zealand's
   economy benefits from a high level of innovation.^[216]

  Trade

   New Zealand is heavily dependent on international trade,^[217]
   particularly in agricultural products.^[218] Exports account for 24% of
   its output,^[143] making New Zealand vulnerable to international commodity
   prices and global economic slowdowns. Food products made up 55% of the
   value of all the country's exports in 2014; wood was the second largest
   earner (7%).^[219] New Zealand's main trading partners, as at June 2018,
   are China (NZ$27.8b), Australia ($26.2b), the European Union ($22.9b), the
   United States ($17.6b), and Japan ($8.4b).^[220] On 7 April 2008, New
   Zealand and China signed the New Zealand–China Free Trade Agreement, the
   first such agreement China has signed with a developed country.^[221] The
   service sector is the largest sector in the economy, followed by
   manufacturing and construction and then farming and raw material
   extraction.^[143] Tourism plays a significant role in the economy,
   contributing $12.9 billion (or 5.6%) to New Zealand's total GDP and
   supporting 7.5% of the total workforce in 2016.^[222] International
   visitor arrivals are expected to increase at a rate of 5.4% annually up to
   2022.^[222]

   Wool has historically been one of New Zealand's major exports.

   Wool was New Zealand's major agricultural export during the late 19th
   century.^[196] Even as late as the 1960s it made up over a third of all
   export revenues,^[196] but since then its price has steadily dropped
   relative to other commodities^[223] and wool is no longer profitable for
   many farmers.^[224] In contrast dairy farming increased, with the number
   of dairy cows doubling between 1990 and 2007,^[225] to become New
   Zealand's largest export earner.^[226] In the year to June 2018, dairy
   products accounted for 17.7% ($14.1 billion) of total exports,^[220] and
   the country's largest company, Fonterra, controls almost one-third of the
   international dairy trade.^[227] Other exports in 2017-18 were meat
   (8.8%), wood and wood products (6.2%), fruit (3.6%), machinery (2.2%) and
   wine (2.1%).^[220] New Zealand's wine industry has followed a similar
   trend to dairy, the number of vineyards doubling over the same
   period,^[228] overtaking wool exports for the first time in
   2007.^[229]^[230]

  Infrastructure

   In 2015, renewable energy, primarily geothermal and hydroelectric power,
   generated 40.1% of New Zealand's gross energy supply.^[231] Geothermal
   power alone accounted for 22% of New Zealand's energy in 2015.^[231]

   The provision of water supply and sanitation is generally of good quality.
   Regional authorities provide water abstraction, treatment and distribution
   infrastructure to most developed areas.^[232]^[233]

   New Zealand's transport network comprises 94,000 kilometres (58,410 mi) of
   roads, including 199 kilometres (124 mi) of motorways,^[234] and 4,128
   kilometres (2,565 mi) of railway lines.^[143] Most major cities and towns
   are linked by bus services, although the private car is the predominant
   mode of transport.^[235] The railways were privatised in 1993, but were
   re-nationalised by the government in stages between 2004 and 2008. The
   state-owned enterprise KiwiRail now operates the railways, with the
   exception of commuter services in Auckland and Wellington which are
   operated by Transdev^[236] and Metlink,^[237] respectively. Railways run
   the length of the country, although most lines now carry freight rather
   than passengers.^[238] Most international visitors arrive via air^[239]
   and New Zealand has six international airports, but currently only the
   Auckland and Christchurch airports connect directly with countries other
   than Australia or Fiji.^[240]

   The New Zealand Post Office had a monopoly over telecommunications in New
   Zealand until 1987 when Telecom New Zealand was formed, initially as a
   state-owned enterprise and then privatised in 1990.^[241] Chorus, which
   was split from Telecom (now Spark) in 2011,^[242] still owns the majority
   of the telecommunications infrastructure, but competition from other
   providers has increased.^[241] A large-scale rollout of gigabit-capable
   fibre to the premises, branded as Ultra-Fast Broadband, began in 2009 with
   a target of being available to 87% of the population by 2022.^[243] As of
   2017, the United Nations International Telecommunication Union ranks New
   Zealand 13th in the development of information and communications
   infrastructure.^[244]

Demography

   Stationary population pyramid broken down into 21 age ranges.

   The 2013 New Zealand census enumerated a resident population of 4,242,048,
   an increase of 5.3% over the 2006 figure.^[245]^[n 8] As of September
   2019, the total population has risen to an estimated 4,933,210.^[5]

   New Zealand is a predominantly urban country, with 73.0% of the population
   living in the seventeen main urban areas (i.e. population 30,000 or
   greater) and 55.1% living in the four largest cities of Auckland,
   Christchurch, Wellington, and Hamilton.^[247] New Zealand cities generally
   rank highly on international livability measures. For instance, in 2016
   Auckland was ranked the world's third most liveable city and Wellington
   the twelfth by the Mercer Quality of Living Survey.^[248]

   Life expectancy for New Zealanders in 2012 was 84 years for females, and
   80.2 years for males.^[249] Life expectancy at birth is forecast to
   increase from 80 years to 85 years in 2050 and infant mortality is
   expected to decline.^[250] New Zealand's fertility rate of 2.1 is
   relatively high for a developed country, and natural births account for a
   significant proportion of population growth. Consequently, the country has
   a young population compared to most industrialised nations, with 20% of
   New Zealanders being 14 years old or younger.^[143] In 2018 the median age
   of the New Zealand population was 38.1 years.^[251] By 2050 the median age
   is projected to rise to 43 years and the percentage of people 60 years of
   age and older to rise from 18% to 29%.^[250] In 2008 the leading cause of
   premature death was cancer, at 29.8%, followed by ischaemic heart disease,
   19.7%, and then cerebrovascular disease, 9.2%.^[252] As of 2016, total
   expenditure on health care (including private sector spending) is 9.2% of
   GDP.^[253]

  Ethnicity and immigration

   In the 2013 census, 74.0% of New Zealand residents identified ethnically
   as European, and 14.9% as Māori. Other major ethnic groups include Asian
   (11.8%) and Pacific peoples (7.4%), two-thirds of whom live in the
   Auckland Region.^[255]^[n 3] The population has become more diverse in
   recent decades: in 1961, the census reported that the population of New
   Zealand was 92% European and 7% Māori, with Asian and Pacific minorities
   sharing the remaining 1%.^[256]

   While the demonym for a New Zealand citizen is New Zealander, the informal
   "Kiwi" is commonly used both internationally^[257] and by locals.^[258]
   The Māori loanword Pākehā has been used to refer to New Zealanders of
   European descent, although others reject this appellation.^[259]^[260] The
   word Pākehā today is increasingly used to refer to all non-Polynesian New
   Zealanders.^[261]

   The Māori were the first people to reach New Zealand, followed by the
   early European settlers. Following colonisation, immigrants were
   predominantly from Britain, Ireland and Australia because of restrictive
   policies similar to the White Australia policy.^[262] There was also
   significant Dutch, Dalmatian,^[263] German, and Italian immigration,
   together with indirect European immigration through Australia, North
   America, South America and South Africa.^[264]^[265] Net migration
   increased after the Second World War; in the 1970s and 1980s policies were
   relaxed and immigration from Asia was promoted.^[265]^[266] In 2009–10, an
   annual target of 45,000–50,000 permanent residence approvals was set by
   the New Zealand Immigration Service—more than one new migrant for every
   100 New Zealand residents.^[267] Just over 25% of New Zealand's population
   was born overseas, with the majority (52%) living in the Auckland Region.
   The United Kingdom remains the largest source of New Zealand's overseas
   population, with a quarter of all overseas-born New Zealanders born there;
   other major sources of New Zealand's overseas-born population are China,
   India, Australia, South Africa, Fiji and Samoa.^[268] The number of
   fee-paying international students increased sharply in the late 1990s,
   with more than 20,000 studying in public tertiary institutions in
   2002.^[269]

   English is the predominant language in New Zealand, spoken by 96.1% of the
   population.^[271] New Zealand English is similar to Australian English and
   many speakers from the Northern Hemisphere are unable to tell the accents
   apart.^[272] The most prominent differences between the New Zealand
   English dialect and other English dialects are the shifts in the short
   front vowels: the short-"i" sound (as in "kit") has centralised towards
   the schwa sound (the "a" in "comma" and "about"); the short-"e" sound (as
   in "dress") has moved towards the short-"i" sound; and the short-"a" sound
   (as in "trap") has moved to the short-"e" sound.^[273]

   After the Second World War, Māori were discouraged from speaking their own
   language (te reo Māori) in schools and workplaces and it existed as a
   community language only in a few remote areas.^[274] It has recently
   undergone a process of revitalisation,^[275] being declared one of New
   Zealand's official languages in 1987,^[276] and is spoken by 3.7% of the
   population.^[271]^[n 9] There are now Māori language immersion schools and
   two television channels that broadcast predominantly in Māori.^[278] Many
   places have both their Māori and English names officially
   recognised.^[279]

   As recorded in the 2013 census,^[271] Samoan is the most widely spoken
   non-official language (2.2%),^[n 10] followed by Hindi (1.7%), "Northern
   Chinese" (including Mandarin, 1.3%) and French (1.2%). 20,235 people
   (0.5%) reported the ability to use New Zealand Sign Language. It was
   declared one of New Zealand's official languages in 2006.^[280]

  Religion

   characteristic of Rātana buildings.

   Christianity is the predominant religion in New Zealand, although its
   society is among the most secular in the world.^[281]^[282] In the 2018
   census, 51.4% of the population identified with one or more religions,
   including 38.6% identifying as Christians. Another 48.6% indicated that
   they had no religion.^[n 11] The main Christian denominations are, by
   number of adherents, Roman Catholicism (10.1%), Anglicanism (6.8%),
   Presbyterianism (5.5%) and "Christian not further defined" (i.e. people
   identifying as Christian but not stating the denomination, 6.6%). The
   Māori-based Ringatū and Rātana religions (1.3%) are also Christian in
   origin.^[284]^[285] Immigration and demographic change in recent decades
   has contributed to the growth of minority religions,^[286] such as
   Hinduism (2.6%), Buddhism (1.1%), Islam (1.3%) and Sikhism (0.5%).^[284]
   The Auckland Region exhibited the greatest religious diversity.^[284]

  Education

   Primary and secondary schooling is compulsory for children aged 6 to 16,
   with the majority attending from the age of 5.^[287] There are 13 school
   years and attending state (public) schools is free to New Zealand citizens
   and permanent residents from a person's 5th birthday to the end of the
   calendar year following their 19th birthday.^[288] New Zealand has an
   adult literacy rate of 99%,^[143] and over half of the population aged 15
   to 29 hold a tertiary qualification.^[287] There are five types of
   government-owned tertiary institutions: universities, colleges of
   education, polytechnics, specialist colleges, and wānanga,^[289] in
   addition to private training establishments.^[290] In the adult population
   14.2% have a bachelor's degree or higher, 30.4% have some form of
   secondary qualification as their highest qualification and 22.4% have no
   formal qualification.^[291] The OECD's Programme for International Student
   Assessment ranks New Zealand's education system as the seventh best in the
   world, with students performing exceptionally well in reading, mathematics
   and science.^[292]

Culture

   creatures

   Early Māori adapted the tropically based east Polynesian culture in line
   with the challenges associated with a larger and more diverse environment,
   eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organisation
   was largely communal with families (whānau), subtribes (hapū) and tribes
   (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira), whose position was subject to the
   community's approval.^[293] The British and Irish immigrants brought
   aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori
   culture,^[294]^[295] particularly with the introduction of
   Christianity.^[296] However, Māori still regard their allegiance to tribal
   groups as a vital part of their identity, and Māori kinship roles resemble
   those of other Polynesian peoples.^[297] More recently American,
   Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on
   New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with
   Pasifika, the world's largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in
   Auckland.^[298]

   The largely rural life in early New Zealand led to the image of New
   Zealanders being rugged, industrious problem solvers.^[299] Modesty was
   expected and enforced through the "tall poppy syndrome", where high
   achievers received harsh criticism.^[300] At the time New Zealand was not
   known as an intellectual country.^[301] From the early 20th century until
   the late 1960s, Māori culture was suppressed by the attempted assimilation
   of Māori into British New Zealanders.^[274] In the 1960s, as tertiary
   education became more available and cities expanded^[302] urban culture
   began to dominate.^[303] However, rural imagery and themes are common in
   New Zealand's art, literature and media.^[304]

   New Zealand's national symbols are influenced by natural, historical, and
   Māori sources. The silver fern is an emblem appearing on army insignia and
   sporting team uniforms.^[305] Certain items of popular culture thought to
   be unique to New Zealand are called "Kiwiana".^[305]

  Art

   As part of the resurgence of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of
   carving and weaving are now more widely practised and Māori artists are
   increasing in number and influence.^[306] Most Māori carvings feature
   human figures, generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking,
   detailed head or a grotesque head.^[307] Surface patterns consisting of
   spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings.^[308] The
   pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses
   (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These
   buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and
   adapting to different whims or needs.^[309]

   Māori decorated the white wood of buildings, canoes and cenotaphs using
   red (a mixture of red ochre and shark fat) and black (made from soot)
   paint and painted pictures of birds, reptiles and other designs on cave
   walls.^[310] Māori tattoos (moko) consisting of coloured soot mixed with
   gum were cut into the flesh with a bone chisel.^[311] Since European
   arrival paintings and photographs have been dominated by landscapes,
   originally not as works of art but as factual portrayals of New
   Zealand.^[312] Portraits of Māori were also common, with early painters
   often portraying them as "noble savages", exotic beauties or friendly
   natives.^[312] The country's isolation delayed the influence of European
   artistic trends allowing local artists to develop their own distinctive
   style of regionalism.^[313] During the 1960s and 1970s many artists
   combined traditional Māori and Western techniques, creating unique art
   forms.^[314] New Zealand art and craft has gradually achieved an
   international audience, with exhibitions in the Venice Biennale in 2001
   and the "Paradise Now" exhibition in New York in 2004.^[306]^[315]

   Māori cloaks are made of fine flax fibre and patterned with black, red and
   white triangles, diamonds and other geometric shapes.^[316] Greenstone was
   fashioned into earrings and necklaces, with the most well-known design
   being the hei-tiki, a distorted human figure sitting cross-legged with its
   head tilted to the side.^[317] Europeans brought English fashion etiquette
   to New Zealand, and until the 1950s most people dressed up for social
   occasions.^[318] Standards have since relaxed and New Zealand fashion has
   received a reputation for being casual, practical and
   lacklustre.^[319]^[320] However, the local fashion industry has grown
   significantly since 2000, doubling exports and increasing from a handful
   to about 50 established labels, with some labels gaining international
   recognition.^[320]

  Literature

   Māori quickly adopted writing as a means of sharing ideas, and many of
   their oral stories and poems were converted to the written form.^[321]
   Most early English literature was obtained from Britain and it was not
   until the 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand
   literature started to become widely known.^[322] Although still largely
   influenced by global trends (modernism) and events (the Great Depression),
   writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on
   their experiences in New Zealand. During this period literature changed
   from a journalistic activity to a more academic pursuit.^[323]
   Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand writers a new
   perspective on New Zealand culture and with the post-war expansion of
   universities local literature flourished.^[324] Dunedin is a UNESCO City
   of Literature.^[325]

  Media and entertainment

   New Zealand music has been influenced by blues, jazz, country, rock and
   roll and hip hop, with many of these genres given a unique New Zealand
   interpretation.^[326] Māori developed traditional chants and songs from
   their ancient Southeast Asian origins, and after centuries of isolation
   created a unique "monotonous" and "doleful" sound.^[327] Flutes and
   trumpets were used as musical instruments^[328] or as signalling devices
   during war or special occasions.^[329] Early settlers brought over their
   ethnic music, with brass bands and choral music being popular, and
   musicians began touring New Zealand in the 1860s.^[330]^[331] Pipe bands
   became widespread during the early 20th century.^[332] The New Zealand
   recording industry began to develop from 1940 onwards and many New Zealand
   musicians have obtained success in Britain and the United States.^[326]
   Some artists release Māori language songs and the Māori tradition-based
   art of kapa haka (song and dance) has made a resurgence.^[333] The New
   Zealand Music Awards are held annually by Recorded Music NZ; the awards
   were first held in 1965 by Reckitt & Colman as the Loxene Golden Disc
   awards.^[334] Recorded Music NZ also publishes the country's official
   weekly record charts.^[335]

   Public radio was introduced in New Zealand in 1922.^[337] A state-owned
   television service began in 1960.^[338] Deregulation in the 1980s saw a
   sudden increase in the numbers of radio and television stations.^[339] New
   Zealand television primarily broadcasts American and British programming,
   along with a large number of Australian and local shows.^[340] The number
   of New Zealand films significantly increased during the 1970s. In 1978 the
   New Zealand Film Commission started assisting local film-makers and many
   films attained a world audience, some receiving international
   acknowledgement.^[339] The highest-grossing New Zealand films are Hunt for
   the Wilderpeople, Boy, The World's Fastest Indian, Once Were Warriors and
   Whale Rider.^[341] The country's diverse scenery and compact size, plus
   government incentives,^[342] have encouraged some producers to shoot
   big-budget productions in New Zealand, including Avatar, The Lord of the
   Rings, The Hobbit, The Chronicles of Narnia, King Kong and The Last
   Samurai.^[343] The New Zealand media industry is dominated by a small
   number of companies, most of which are foreign-owned, although the state
   retains ownership of some television and radio stations.^[344] Since 1994,
   Freedom House has consistently ranked New Zealand's press freedom in the
   top twenty, with the 19th freest media in 2015.^[345]

  Sports

   Most of the major sporting codes played in New Zealand have British
   origins.^[346] Rugby union is considered the national sport^[347] and
   attracts the most spectators.^[348] Golf, netball, tennis and cricket have
   the highest rates of adult participation, while netball, rugby union and
   football (soccer) are particularly popular among young people.^[348]^[349]
   Around 54% of New Zealand adolescents participate in sports for their
   school.^[349] Victorious rugby tours to Australia and the United Kingdom
   in the late 1880s and the early 1900s played an early role in instilling a
   national identity.^[350] Horseracing was also a popular spectator sport
   and became part of the "Rugby, Racing and Beer" culture during the
   1960s.^[351] Māori participation in European sports was particularly
   evident in rugby and the country's team performs a haka, a traditional
   Māori challenge, before international matches.^[352] New Zealand is known
   for its extreme sports, adventure tourism^[353] and strong mountaineering
   tradition, as seen in the success of notable New Zealander Sir Edmund
   Hillary.^[354]^[355] Other outdoor pursuits such as cycling, fishing,
   swimming, running, tramping, canoeing, hunting, snowsports, surfing and
   sailing are also popular.^[356] The Polynesian sport of waka ama racing
   has experienced a resurgence of interest in New Zealand since the
   1980s.^[357]

   New Zealand has competitive international teams in rugby union, rugby
   league, netball, cricket, softball, and sailing. New Zealand participated
   at the Summer Olympics in 1908 and 1912 as a joint team with Australia,
   before first participating on its own in 1920.^[358] The country has
   ranked highly on a medals-to-population ratio at recent Games.^[359]^[360]
   The "All Blacks", the national rugby union team, are the most successful
   in the history of international rugby^[361] and the reigning World Cup
   champions.^[362]

  Cuisine

   Ingredients to be prepared for a hāngi

   The national cuisine has been described as Pacific Rim, incorporating the
   native Māori cuisine and diverse culinary traditions introduced by
   settlers and immigrants from Europe, Polynesia and Asia.^[363] New Zealand
   yields produce from land and sea—most crops and livestock, such as maize,
   potatoes and pigs, were gradually introduced by the early European
   settlers.^[364] Distinctive ingredients or dishes include lamb, salmon,
   kōura (crayfish),^[365] dredge oysters, whitebait, pāua (abalone),
   mussels, scallops, pipis and tuatua (both are types of New Zealand
   shellfish),^[366] kūmara (sweet potato), kiwifruit, tamarillo and pavlova
   (considered a national dish).^[367]^[363] A hāngi is a traditional Māori
   method of cooking food using heated rocks buried in a pit oven. After
   European colonisation, Māori began cooking with pots and ovens and the
   hāngi was used less frequently, although it is still used for formal
   occasions such as tangihanga.^[368]

       language, New Zealand Sign Language is also an official language of
       New Zealand. The New Zealand Sign Language Act 2006 permits the use of
       NZSL in legal proceedings, facilitates competency standards for its
       interpretation and guides government departments in its promotion and
       use. English, the medium for teaching and learning in most schools, is
       a de facto official language by virtue of its widespread use. For
       these reasons, these three languages have special mention in the New
       Zealand Curriculum.
