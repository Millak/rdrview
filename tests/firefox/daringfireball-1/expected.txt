Server Software

   The Daring Fireball website is hosted by Joyent.

   Articles and links are published through Movable Type. In addition to my
   own SmartyPants and Markdown plug-ins, Daring Fireball uses several
   excellent Movable Type plug-ins, including Brad Choate’s MT-Regex and
   MT-IfEmpty, and Nat Irons’s Amputator.

   Stats are tracked using Mint. Additional web nerdery, including the
   membership system, is fueled by Perl, PHP, and MySQL.

Web Standards

   Web standards are important, and Daring Fireball adheres to them.
   Specifically, Daring Fireball’s HTML markup should validate as either HTML
   5 or XHTML 4.01 Transitional, its layout is constructed using valid CSS,
   and its syndicated feed is valid Atom.

   If Daring Fireball looks goofy in your browser, you’re likely using a
   shitty browser that doesn’t support web standards. Internet Explorer, I’m
   looking in your direction. If you complain about this, I will laugh at
   you, because I do not care. If, however, you are using a modern,
   standards-compliant browser and have trouble viewing or reading Daring
   Fireball, please do let me know.
